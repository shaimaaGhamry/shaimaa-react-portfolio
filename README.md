# REACT Portfolio
This is a portfolio application built with React, designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience. The application consists of a single-page website that includes the following sections:

* About Me: A brief introduction about myself, including a profile picture, background, and interests.

* Portfolio: A list of my projects, each with a thumbnail image, title, description, and link to the live website or source code.

* Resume: A list of my technical skills, such as programming languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies.

* Contact: A contact form where visitors can send me a message or connect with me on social media.


The application is built with modern web development technologies, including:

* React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Bootstrap: A front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first web applications.
* GitHub Pages: A free static site hosting service provided by GitHub.
